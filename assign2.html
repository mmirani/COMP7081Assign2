        <h1>Assignment 2</h1>
        
        <h2>Introduction of Project</h2>
        <p>
	        The goal of this project is to implement a system for the Car Rental company called SuperRent. The primary activity of SuperRent is to rent out cars and trucks to users. We will be outlining how the system can rent vehicles, return vehicles, exchange points to rent or purchase vehicles and buy insurance. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
	        The car rental company SuperRent needs a system that will help streamline their operating procedures. The system will need to handle the different services SuperRent offers. These services include customers:
			<ul>
                <li>renting vehicles.</li>
				<li>returning vehicles.</li>
				<li>exchanging points to rent or buy a vehicle.</li>
				<li>buying insurance for the rented vehicle.</li>
            </ul>
			The proposed SuperRent system should allow SuperRent employees to process all of these requests and store the required information within a single system.
        </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>I provide the Clerk with the vehicle I want and the day I wish to return it (location and pickup day are irrelevant as I am a walk-in customer, they are defaulted to the branch I am in and today?s date).</li>
                    <li>If such a vehicle is available, I provide the Clerk with my name and phone number.</li>
                    <li>I decide if I want insurance.</li>

                    <li>I provide the Clerk with the Confirmation number OR my phone number.</li>
                    <li>I decide if I want insurance.</li>
                    <li>I provide the Clerk with my driver?s licence number, credit card and credit card expiry date.</li>
                    <li>I leave the rental agency with the vehicle.</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>I return to the rental agency.</li>
                    <li>The Clerk performs the vehicle checks and informs me what I owe.</li>
                    <li>I indicate if I want to pay using Credit Card OR Cash OR if I am a SuperRent Club member, points to pay for my rental OR a combination of one of the first two and points. Knowing that I can use 1000 points per day for a premium or lower vehicle, OR 1500 points per day for a luxury, SUV, van or truck.</li>
                    <li>I expect to receive back an additional Club point for every $5 I have spent.</li>
                    <li>I receive any payment documentation for the rental and leave the rental agency.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>As a Customer, I want to be able to purchase a used vehicle from SuperRent.</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>I approach the Manager and select a car from his list of available used Vehicles.</li>
                    <li>I provide the Manager with my name, telephone number and driver?s license.</li>
                    <li>I decide on my method of payment, Cash OR Credit Card (In this case I provide the credit card number and expiry date), AND if I am a SuperRent Club member, points to be used for the transaction. Knowing that every 2000 points I use is equivalent to $100.</li>
                    <li>I receive any payment documentation for the purchase and leave the rental agency.</li>
                </ol>

			<p>
			At the DFD0 level, the the SuperRent System is depicted as a single bubble interacting with the external systems. Here we have the clerk who enters data into the system and that results in a vehicle type being given to the customer and the transaction information being displayed on the clerk's screen.

			<h4>Data Flow Diagram 1</h4>
			<p>
			At the DFD1 level, the chart is updated to show the flow of data through the system. The information of the request goes to the corresponding module (rent, buy or return). Then the data goes to any additional modules needed in those situations (insurance, points). After all required information for the transaction is gathered, it is stored to the SuperRent system in the "Transaction Information" storage module. Then the data for the request is sent out as a vehicle and to the clerk's screen.

        <h3>Architecture</h3>
		<div class="col-md-12">
			<p>
	        The system follows a Data-Flow Architecture design. The GUI is where The system is access and customer data is entered. From the GUI, three different modules can be selected based on what the customer needs to do: rent, buy or return.
			</p>
			<p>
			If renting a vehicle, the rent vehicle module will be loaded. The system checks if this customer has a reservation and updates the rent module with the reservation information. Then the insurance module is loaded and weekly, daily or hourly insurance is selected. The system loads the vehicle inventory module and checks a vehicle out. The paperwork is processed and given to the customer at checkout.
			</p>
			<p>
			If buying a vehicle, the buy vehicle module will be loaded. The system loads the used vehicle inventory module and a vehicle is selected from the available inventory. The billing module is loaded where the customer's billing information is entered. At this stage the points system can be accessed if the customer is using points to purchase the vehicle. After all of the information has been entered the customer is charged. Then the checkout module is loaded where the paperwork is processed and given to the customer.
			</p>
			<p>
			If returning a vehicle, the return vehicle module will be loaded. The system access the vehicle's usage information and it is updated with the updated information from the returned vehicle. The billing module is loaded where the customer's billing information is entered. At this stage the points system can be accessed if the customer is using points to pay for the rental vehicle. After all of the information has been entered the customer is charged. Then the checkout module is loaded where the paperwork is processed and given to the customer.

        <h3>User Interface</h3>
        <p>

        <h2>Process Model</h2>
        
        <h3>Iterative Development Method</h3>

        <p>The development methodology that will be used for this project is the Iterative Development Method.  As mentioned above, the architecture of the project has been divided into three modules: renting, buying and returning.  Each module will have it's own unique functions, but there will be core components that are shared between them.  Because of the nature of the architecture, the iterative development process fits in nicely.  We are going to make sure the client is intimately involved in the development process to ensure that we are on the right track after each module. The client will make sure requirements are being met, functionality is what was intended and will do general testing for the team.</p>
        

        <p>The Scrum framework will be used for making sure the project is on track.  There will be three sprints that are each 30 days in length (20 business days).  Standard scrum procedures will be followed such as daily stand up meetings, sprint plans, and review meetings.</p>

        <h4>Analysis</h4>

        <p>After the initial meeting with the SuperRent manager, a list of required features was compiled for the website development and from this use cases and user stories were formulated (seen above)  The requirements outlined in these meetings formed the base of the projects scope and depth.</p>

        <h4>Design</h4>

        <p>The initial stage of the design process will consist of a series of wireframes (low fidelity designs) based on the clients requirements.  These wireframes will be proposed to the client and his users for feedback and revisions.  Once the wireframes are complete and usable, Photoshop mockups (high fidelity designs) will be created which will give a better visual representation of the final product.</p>


        <h4>Implementation</h4>

        <p>For front-end development, HTML5, CSS3, JQuery, JQuery UI and Twitter Bootstrap will be used.</p>

        <p>For back-end development, C# and .NET 4.5 will be used.</p>

        <p>For data storage and searching, MS SQL Server will be used.</p>


        <h4>Testing</h4>

        <p>Testing will be done along the way by the programmer on his own code and others via peer review.  The SuperRent Manager will also be involved in testing functionality and business requirements.</p>

        <p>After all development is complete according to the business requirements, and after each iteration, the relevant (completed) items below will be tested.  All items complete to date will be tested, even if it was developed as part of a previous iteration.  This regression testing will ensure that no previous work was affected by new development.</p>
